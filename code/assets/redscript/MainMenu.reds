// Adds a MULTIPLAYER entry to the main menu, beside Continue / New Game / Load Game.
//
// Written against the game's own script source, which ships at
// <game>\tools\redmod\scripts\ and is authoritative for the installed patch:
//
//   cyberpunk/UI/fullscreen/pregame/singleplayerMenu.script:843
//       SingleplayerMenuGameController.PopulateMenuItemList()
//   cyberpunk/UI/fullscreen/pregame/singleplayerMenu.script:1001
//       HandleMenuItemActivate() - where Continue actually loads a save
//   cyberpunk/UI/menus/menuItemListGameController.script:56
//       AddMenuItem(label, spawnEvent: CName) -> pushes PauseMenuListItemData
//
// Everything lives on the CONTROLLER on purpose. The first attempt put the handler on
// MenuScenario_SingleplayerMenu and failed to compile with UNRESOLVED_FN on
// GetSystemRequestsHandler - that is a method declared on widgetController
// (core/ui/baseControllers/widgetController.script:84), not a free function, so it only
// resolves on classes that inherit it. The controller does; the scenario does not.

    // decided which character you played. It does not any more: the server owns your
    // appearance, your name and your position, and applies all three on arrival. Whichever
    // save loads underneath is scenery.

// NOTE THE ref<>. The game's own source declares this as `data : PauseMenuListItemData`,
// and copying that signature across breaks the ENTIRE mod: redscript requires class types
// to be reached through ref or wref, and it aborts all compilation on one bad file. The
// game then starts with no scripts at all - no menu entry, no chat, no HUD - while looking
// like the mod simply did nothing. The .script dialect the game ships is not redscript.
